This research makes use of SQL and sophisticated database techniques to investigate children's welfare in the host counties for the Young Lives study and to better understand the effects of childhood poverty. 
Young Lives is a groundbreaking, in-depth study of poverty and inequality that has been tracking the lives of 12,000 kids in two age groups in Ethiopia, India, Peru, and Vietnam every three to four years. Child Education & Skills, Health, and Well-Being were the main areas of concentration, and these were thoroughly investigated to elucidate research findings.
